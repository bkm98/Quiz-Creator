# Inception

## Introduction
Quiz Creator will be a Windows application that lets people make, edit, save, open, and take quizzes.  Students could use it to build up their memory and knowledge about a subject.  It could be used by schools or organizations to test the knowledge of a student or potential hire.  It could be used as a game to test friends’ trivia knowledge.  It will provide a simple all in one solution to everyone’s desktop quiz-related needs.
## Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments
**IVP Statement:** A user friendly desktop application that allows for the creation, management, and assessment of quizzes so that students and teachers can facilitate a smooth learning experience.
- Jobs
    - Students need to be involved in the learning process by actively testing what they do and don’t know. 
    - Material needs to be readily available and well organized for easy studying on the go and in between narrow time slots.
    - Teachers have to test their students over competency of their material. 
    - Establish a healthy relationship between teacher and student by consolidating how quizzes are viewed, i.e. the quiz you took in class today is the same quiz you see on Quiz Creator, and is ready for further study.
- Customer Pains
    - Flashcards can be time costly to create, color code, and keep organized, therefore a desktop app can bring ease to the creation and management of quizzes.
    - Sometimes powerpoint can be tedious to create when it comes to quizzes as a slide is needed for the question AND the answer, effectively doubling the amount of work needed for each question created.
    - For certain browser quiz creators, a subscription is needed to see the quizzes created by other students/teachers; establishing a simple back and forth between quiz creators and quiz takers allows for more overall quizzes taken due to ease of access.
- Desired Gains
    - Quick, customizable, and accessible way to quiz someone (or yourself). 
    - Quizzes created and already administered by Professors/Instructors are readily available for students to further study.
    - Quizzes based on the same class/topic are marked as related and are easily found by other students.

**Customer Segments:** Our most important customers are related to the academic world. Both students and teachers alike should feel comfortable creating and viewing quizzes together, to better emphasize content learned in lecture. Both these customers share a similar archetype in that one customer wants people to learn their material (instructors), while the other customer needs to adequately learn the material in order to receive passing grades (students). What better way to facilitate this mutual need for learning than a constant, easy access to quizzes? Repetition is key, therefore having an organized desktop app filled with valuable quizzes allows for less stress to be put on the creation of study outlets and more stress on the memorization of key knowledge.
## Interviews
### Interview 1 
**Interviewer:** Tyler Riese
**Interviewee:** Jeffery Riese
**Interview Date:** July 9th 2020
**Career:** Field Support Manager 
**Company:** KLA
**Daily on job duties:** Responding to emails, directing employees to work priorities, Hiring. 

**Questions:** 
**Q: How could this application be used in your job field?**
A: During the hiring process, and to test the knowledge of new employees before committing them to a project or assignment. 

**Q:If you chose to use this application, on what platform would it be preferred?**
A: Computer, mobile is fine as well however everyone has their own work computer thus it would make it easier to distribute and facilitate as we could pre-install the software on the company computers. 

**Q: What would be the price, if any you would pay for software like this?**
A: It would have to be innovative and high quality software to have a price tag. We have many talented staff members who could most likely write the program themselves if we needed them to. 

**Q: What are some things you would like to see in the application, or not in the application?**
A: Would like to see an easy to use interface that someone brand new to technology could interact with, additionally the ability to save and reuse quizzes or questions if needed. 
Does not want to see any ads or unneeded gimmicks, just a simple application that does what we need it to do.

**Key insights:** Jeff has worked a lot with computers, both hardware and software and clearly knows his way around a piece of technology. After interviewing him I can conclude that for the app to be taken seriously, at least on the business side that it should feature a professional look and feel with nothing too flashy. Features do not need to be over the top, but rather just have good working core mechanics. 

**Conclusion:** Although I did get some good insight towards the development of our application. I think that we should focus on making the application appeal towards a lower level audience. Businesses such as KLA have little need for something like this as they are more than capable of producing their own products. Aiming lower towards a student or teaching level would most likely provide better results and satisfaction.  

### Interview 2
**Interviewer:** Steven Sprouls
**Interviewee:** Caitlin Eldringhoff
**Interview Date:** July 9th 2020
**Occupation:** Full Time Student at NAU 

**Questions:**
**Q: How could this application be utilized by you and other students?**
A: This application would best be used to help study for exams / finals. Students could compile a list of questions they need to study the most and use this in a similar fashion to other studying tools such as flash cards.

**Q: If you chose to use this application, on what platform would it be preferred?**
A: This would be preferred to be used on Windows computers as most that is what most students including myself have. Secondary platforms would be mobile devices.

**Q: What would be the price, if any, you would pay for this application?**
A: This application should either be completely free to use or very inexpensive. There are other products out there that are free that can be used in a similar fashion and it would be difficult to convince people to pay very much for this unless it has features or some kind of utility that can’t be found anywhere else. 

**Q: What are some things you would like to see in the application?**
A: I would like to see the ability to make different types of questions, such as multiple choice, matching, and true or false. Also you should be able to save and name tests after creating them and their scores after someone has taken them. The capability to add pictures to questions and answers would be a nice addition as well.

**Key insights:** Caitlin’s interview has led me to see that this app would in fact be used by students such as herself, but only under certain conditions. These conditions being that the application should not cost very much if at all, that it should be easy to use, and that it should have certain key features such as question types to make it more appealing.

**Conclusion / Assessment:** From the information I gained from this interview I believe that we should focus on making our app as user friendly as possible so more students would want to use it, but the development of the application should not be too complex and costly because most people will not want to spend very much money on such an application. 

### Interview 3
**Interviewer:** Bryan Stahman
**Interviewee:** Nicole Stahman
**Interview Date:** July 10th 2020
**Consumer Segment:** University Student

**Questions:**
**Q: What features would you like to see on a study application?**
A: She would like to see the ability to create and easily view flashcards, as well as the ability to create and store notes directly from a lecture. She also thinks there should be an easy way for students to share notes and quizzes with each other.

**Q: How much would you pay for an application like this?**
A: With the amount of free study applications that already exist, combined with the fact that many college students are on a tight budget, she believes most students would not be willing to pay anything. 

**Q: If you could choose a platform for this application, what would it be?**
A: This application might be best on desktop computers or mobile devices because that is what most students have access to. She believes a mobile version would be the most popular and useful.

**Q: How would this application be utilized by you and other students?**
A: This application could be used to study for quizzes and tests, as well as retaining information learned after a lecture. It could potentially be used between multiple students as a group-study application.

**Key Insights:** My interview with Nicole gave me insight into which features we would need to implement in order for our application to appeal to students. We would likely need to add a mobile version of our app in order to reach the most college-age users. Our application would need to be free, given all of the existing study resources.

**Conclusion / Assessment:** If we decide to target college students, our application must have an easy way to create and review different types of quizzes. We should also strongly consider adding a flashcard feature, as it is incredibly useful when it comes to studying certain subjects. It would be nice to have a way for students and teachers to easily share quizzes with each other. We could also perhaps develop a mobile application in conjunction with our desktop application so students can study on-the-go.

## Final Value Proposition
**IVP Statement:** A user friendly desktop application that allows for the creation, management, and assessment of quizzes within organizations so that students, teachers, and businesses can facilitate a smooth learning experience.

    - Students need to be involved in the learning process by actively testing what they do and don’t know. 
    - Material needs to be readily available and well organized for easy studying on the go and in between narrow time slots.
    - Teachers have to test their students over competency of their material. 
    - Establish a healthy relationship between teacher and student by consolidating how quizzes are viewed, i.e. the quiz you took in class today is the same quiz you see on Quiz Creator, and is ready for further study.

    - For certain browser quiz creators, a subscription is needed to see the quizzes created by other students/teachers; establishing a simple back and forth between quiz creators and quiz takers allows for more overall quizzes taken due to ease of access.
    - Other similar resources, such as Quizlet, make all materials public and accessible to everyone online, which enables students to cheat and instructors cannot ensure fair grading.
- Desired Gains
    - Quick, customizable, and accessible way to quiz someone (or yourself). 
    - Quizzes created and already administered by Professors/Instructors are readily available for students to further study.
    - Quizzes based on the same class/topic are marked as related and are easily found by other students.

**Customer Segments:** Based on the research conducted, we have concluded that our main customer base would be organizations such as companies and schools. Because students are often reluctant to spend extra money on services they may be able to do without, it would be easier to design our product to appeal to organizations that can use our application for exams or interview questions. To differentiate ourselves from websites like Quizlet that have gained a reputation for making cheating on exams easier due to all content being public, we intend to make exams and answers private and limit access to within an organization.
