# Implementation 1

## 1. Introduction
	Quiz Creator is a desktop application that allows students and educators to effortlessly create,
	edit, sort, and administer quizzes while emphasizing privacy and security so that educators feel comfortable
	distributing their material amongst their students, without fear of acadmic dishonesty. In this first implementation
	of our program, users can create a quiz and save it on their local machine. Users can also take quizzes they have
	created, and recieve a score immediately upon submission.
