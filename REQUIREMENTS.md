# Requirements

## 1. Positioning

### 1.1 Problem Statement

	- The problem of uneffective and inefficient studying methods affects
	college students; the impact of which is performing poorly on exams
	and receiving a low grade and lowering their overall GPA.

### 1.2 Product Position Statement

	- For college students who have a difficult time developing successful
	studying methods, Quiz Creator is a studying app that allows students
	to create their own tests for the purpose of quizzing their own knowledge
	and for professors to create quizzes to privately distribute amongst their
	students providing what could be used as a study guide; unlike Quizlet,
	our product does not allow test questions and their answers to be distributed
	publicly.

### 1.3 Value proposition

## 2. Stakeholders

## 3. Function requirements (features)

## 4. Non-functional requirements

## 5. MVP

For developing the minimum viable product for this application, our strategy is to first develop a simple, barebones program and add features one at a time. We will first implement our functional requirements stated above. By implementing only the functional requirements in our MVP, we can gather early feedback from users about our application without wasting any time on less important features. We will use this early feedback to decide which features we should validate and which we should change.
