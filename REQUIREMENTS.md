	and receiving a low grade and lowering their overall GPA.

### 1.2 Product Position Statement

	- For college students who have a difficult time developing successful
	studying methods, Quiz Creator is a studying app that allows students
	to create their own tests for the purpose of quizzing their own knowledge
